# creating_folder_structure_for_new_project
This Python script creates a standardized folder structure for a new project. It prompts the user for the project path and name, and then generates folders such as 'app', 'config', 'db', 'tests', and 'venv'. The structure helps organize code, configuration, databases, tests, and virtual environments.
